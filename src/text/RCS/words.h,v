searching for ISBN and ISSN data. */

#define MAXNUMERIC	15
	/* Maximum number of numeric characters permitted in a word.
	   This avoids MG_long_t sequences of numbers creating just one
	   word occurrence for each number. At most 10,000 all numeric

/* For mg version 1.3x, we allow a few other characters in words, to
support searching for ISBN and ISSN values, programming language
identifiers, and names like O'Reilly.  An experiment to include colon to
support BibNet-style citation labels was abandoned because then words
ending in a colon are indexed with the colon, e.g.  "Albert Einstein:
Philosopher-Scientist" will not produce a match on Einstein, but only on
Einstein:, which a searcher would not expect.  BibNet-style citation
labels can still be found, using Boolean search, e.g.  "Knuth:1988:TP"
can be found as "knuth & 1988 & tp".

Ideas for future work: index subwords of words, so that Internet host
names, URLs, parts of ISBNs, etc can also be searched for. */
