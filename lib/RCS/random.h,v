/*
 *	A random number generator called as a function by
 *	random (iseed)	or	irandm (iseed)
 *	The parameter should be a pointer to a 2-element MG_long_t vector.
 *	The first function returns a double uniform in 0 .. 1.
 *	The second returns a MG_long_t integer uniform in 0 .. 2**31-1
 *	Both update iseed[] in exactly the same way.
 *	iseed[] must be a 2-element integer vector.
 *	The initial value of the second element may be anything.
 *
 *	The period of the random sequence is 2**32 * (2**32-1)
 *	The table mt[0:127] is defined by mt[i] = 69069 ** (128-i)
